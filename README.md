# HotGame

This is a decentralized HEAD OR TAILS GAME with proven randomness

It is not a live game, so you can submit a bet stored in the blockchain
and wait for someone to follow your bet, or you can follow a bet already submitted.
Submitters will always have the possibility to claim back there bet if no one followed,
as long as they claim back with the submitting wallet address.

There is no limit on the size bets you can submit nor the number of bets.

Random numbers are generated with Chainlink. Meaning, all the random numbers
are truly random, with provable randomness.
 
some fees are added to the bet and send to the contract owner, in order to add some LINK tokens
to the contract address, which is mandatory to generate fully random number.
